# Mean Stack App

## Description
This application is based on the MEAN Stack (MongoDb, Express, Angular, Node). 

This project use:
- Atlas for mongodb database (if you wont to test it by your MongoDB local installation change de .env configuration

- Angular Material for UI with minimal use of Bootstrap 5.

The application is under development and foresees the implementation of NLP-based text analysis statistics

## Installation

By my choice the project is provisionally divided into two different subfolders one for the frontend and one for the backend, even if in preproduction back and front are on the same server, the division will facilitate the arrangement on two different servers.

Subfolders structure

-- angular-frontend (this is the Angular project)
-- node-express-server (this the express api project)

1. Clone this repository
2. Go into the angular-frontend subfolder and open in terminal
3. Type `npm i`
4. Run the angular project : `npm start`
5. Go into the node-express-server subfolder and open in terminal
6. Install the node modules : `npm i`
7. Run the node app : `npm start`

Go to http://localhost:4200
